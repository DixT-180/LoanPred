# The saved pickled MODEL is already included in the artifacts folder, just run the app.py.
# The solution steps are provided in task1-solution.pdf.

# For DATA INGESTION, TRANSFORMATION AND MODEL TRAINING.

# 1. First, run the data_ingestion.py for data ingestion, data transformation and finally model development.

# 2. Now, the saved model.pkl and preprocessor.pkl can be obtained in the artifacts folder.

# 3. Run the app.py flask application and look in port:5000/predictdata.

# 4. enter the data in input fields.

# 5. You will have predictions.

# 6. You can also run the chat.py for predictions, it also uses the same saved model from the /artifacts. It is more interactive.

# if you encounter any errors check the log file for the tracking the progress.
